            <H2> What is HIV/AIDS </h2>
        <P> HIV (human immunodeficiency virus) is a virus that attacks the body's immune system. If HIV is not treated,
            it can lead to AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome). There is currently no effective cure. Once people
            get HIV, they have it for life. But with proper medical care, HIV can be controlled.</P>
